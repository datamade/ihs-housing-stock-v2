### Setup

#### Pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run on your local machine before every commit.

We use the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework to run code linters and formatters that keep our codebase clean.

To set up Pre-Commit, install the Python package on your local machine using:

```bash
python -m pip install pre-commit
```

If you'd rather not install pre-commit globally, create and activate a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in this repo before running the above command.

Then, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Since hooks are run locally, you can modify which scripts are run before each commit by modifying `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
